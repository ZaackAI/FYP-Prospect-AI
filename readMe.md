# Deepface's scan analysis

## Using multiple face analysis tools to find the most effective one for
## our application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.9 (Microsoft Store)
- Git (Google)

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [the URL of your repository - you'll get this after creating it on a platform like GitHub]
    cd FYP-xx
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv  # Or python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Code

* **For Python scripts (.py files):**
    ```bash
    python your_main_script.py
    ```

* **For Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files):**
    1.  Make sure Jupyter Notebook is installed in your virtual environment (it should be in `requirements.txt` if you've used it).
    2.  Navigate to the project folder in your terminal (with the virtual environment activated).
    3.  Run: `jupyter notebook`
    4.  This will open Jupyter in your web browser, and your team members can open and run the `.ipynb` files.
